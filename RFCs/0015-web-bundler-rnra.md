# Web Bundler for React Native Applications (Web-Bundler-RNRA)

## 1. Introduction

This RFC introduces the Web Bundler for React Native Applications (Web-Bundler-RNRA), a new component designed to bundle web application code for execution within React Native's WebView. The Web-Bundler-RNRA aims to streamline the process of developing, bundling, and deploying web content that can be seamlessly integrated into React Native applications, with an initial focus on web bundles and the potential to support React Native code bundling in the future.

## 2. Background

React Native developers often need to integrate web applications into their mobile applications using WebView. The process of preparing web application code for this environment requires bundling, which can include transpilation, minification, and packaging. Currently, there is a gap in the React Native ecosystem for a tool that specifically addresses the bundling of web application code for WebView integration.

## 3. Objectives

- To create a bundling tool that prepares web application code for integration into React Native applications via WebView.
- To provide a seamless user experience where developers can write code in a React Native code editor and send it to the Web-Bundler-RNRA for bundling.
- To support the initial bundling of web applications with the vision to extend functionality to include React Native code bundling.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Web Application Bundling

- **Bundling Process**: Implement a bundling process that handles transpilation, minification, and packaging of web application code.
- **Integration with Code Editors**: Ensure compatibility with React Native code editors, allowing developers to send code directly to the bundler.

### 4.2 React Native Code Bundling (Future Scope)

- **React Native Support**: Outline the potential for future support of React Native code bundling, enabling the same tool to prepare React Native components and modules for distribution.

### 4.3 User Experience

- **Ease of Use**: Design the bundler with a focus on ease of use, providing clear documentation and a straightforward interface.
- **Feedback and Error Handling**: Provide real-time feedback and comprehensive error handling during the bundling process to assist developers in troubleshooting.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

- **Modular Design**: Develop the Web-Bundler-RNRA as a modular component that can be integrated into existing React Native development workflows.
- **Extensibility**: Ensure the architecture allows for future expansion to support React Native code bundling.

## 6. Use Cases

- **Web Content Integration**: Developers can bundle web application code to be loaded into a WebView within a React Native application, providing rich web-based features.
- **Dynamic Content Creation**: Enable dynamic creation and bundling of content that can be updated and deployed without the need for a full application update.

## 7. Conclusion

The Web-Bundler-RNRA represents a critical tool for React Native developers, filling a gap in the current ecosystem by providing a dedicated bundling solution for web applications. With the introduction of the Native-Bundler-RNRA, the capabilities of the Web-Bundler-RNRA are further expanded to support in-app bundling of React Native code as well. This enhancement will broaden the development experience and expand the possibilities for content integration within React Native applications.
