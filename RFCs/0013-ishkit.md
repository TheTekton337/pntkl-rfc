# iSHKit - Shell Environment Integration for React Native on iOS

## 1. Introduction

This RFC introduces iSHKit, a toolkit for integrating a comprehensive shell environment into React Native applications on iOS. iSHKit leverages the power of iSH, an iOS Linux shell application, to provide developers with the ability to execute shell commands, scripts, and manage file systems within their React Native apps.

## 2. Background

The need for advanced scripting and command execution capabilities within mobile applications has grown as applications become more complex and feature-rich. iSHKit aims to address this need by providing a bridge between React Native and the robust capabilities of a Linux shell environment on iOS devices.

## 3. Objectives

- To enable the execution of Linux shell commands and scripts directly within React Native applications on iOS.
- To provide a seamless integration of iSH's Linux shell environment with React Native, allowing for advanced file system management and script execution.
- To ensure a secure and isolated environment for executing shell commands to maintain application and device integrity.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Shell Command Execution

- **Command Execution**: Allow React Native applications to execute Linux shell commands through iSHKit.
- **Script Management**: Enable the running and management of shell scripts, providing developers with the ability to automate tasks within their applications.

### 4.2 File System Management

- **File Operations**: Support common file operations such as read, write, delete, and navigate within the Linux environment provided by iSH.
- **Directory Management**: Facilitate the creation, modification, and deletion of directories, enabling complex file system structures.

### 4.3 Integration with rtn-pntkl-shell

- **Unified Interface**: iSHKit will be utilized by rtn-pntkl-shell, a Fabric component using experimental codegen, to provide a common component for iOS that interacts with the shell environment.

### 4.4 Security and Isolation

- **Isolated Execution**: Ensure that all shell operations are performed within an isolated environment to prevent any potential impact on the host iOS system.
- **Permission Management**: Implement strict permission checks and controls for executing shell commands to safeguard against unauthorized access.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

- **iSH Integration**: Outline the steps for integrating iSH within React Native applications, including the setup of iSHKit and communication with rtn-pntkl-shell.
- **API Documentation**: Provide comprehensive API documentation for developers to interact with the shell environment through iSHKit.

## 6. Use Cases

- **Development Tools**: Developers can use iSHKit to integrate development tools and environments directly into their React Native applications, enhancing the development workflow.
- **Automation and Scripting**: Leverage iSHKit for automating tasks and running maintenance scripts within the application, improving efficiency and performance.

## 7. Conclusion

The introduction of iSHKit represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of React Native applications on iOS. By providing direct access to a Linux shell environment and integrating with the Native-Bundler-RNRA for in-app bundling, developers can unlock new levels of functionality and automation within their applications, driving innovation and user satisfaction.
