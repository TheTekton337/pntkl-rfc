# Data Persistence and State Management RFC for User Customizations (DPSM-RNRA)

## 1. Introduction

The Data Persistence and State Management for User Customizations (DPSM-RNRA) document integrates within the Communication Protocol (CP-RNRA), Application Configuration Standard (ACS-RNRA), Turing Universal Customization Standard (TUCS-RNRA), and Development and Customization Toolkit (DCTK-RNRA). This RFC focuses on the essential mechanisms and standards for managing the persistence of data and state within user customizations in React and React-Native applications, emphasizing the support role of base application developers in this context.

## 2. Background

With applications increasingly supporting user customizations for enhanced adaptability and personalization, the complexity of managing associated state and data grows. DPSM-RNRA aims to standardize data persistence and state management for user customizations, ensuring a seamless user experience across sessions and devices.

## 3. Objectives

- Outline standards for managing data persistence and state in user customizations.
- Ensure seamless maintenance of state and data across sessions and devices.
- Define base application developer responsibilities for supporting customization data management.
- Promote data handling best practices to ensure performance and user experience.

## 4. Framework for Data Persistence and State Management in User Customizations

### 4.1 State Management in Customizations

- **State Isolation**: State of user customizations should be isolated from the base application to prevent conflicts.
- **State APIs**: APIs should be provided by base developers for efficient state saving and retrieval within customizations.

### 4.2 Data Persistence Mechanisms

- **Local Storage Utilization**: Utilize local storage for persisting customization settings, ensuring compatibility across platforms.
- **Synchronization Services**: Enable synchronization of customization data across devices and sessions to enhance user experience.

### 4.3 P2P Support for Customizations

- **P2P Frameworks**: Introduce the use of P2P frameworks like gun.js, among others, as an option for decentralized data storage and synchronization for customizations. This approach can augment traditional cloud-based solutions by enabling direct peer-to-peer communication and data exchange.
- **Framework Evaluation**: While gun.js provides a real-time, decentralized database that could fit well with React and React-Native environments, other possibilities include libp2p for building peer-to-peer network applications and IPFS for decentralized file storage. Selection should be based on customization requirements, considering factors such as ease of integration, scalability, and data security.

### 4.4 Supporting Customization Data Management

- **Data Lifecycle Hooks**: Lifecycle hooks and events should be introduced for managing data persistence and state changes effectively within customizations.
- **Data Access Controls**: Implement mechanisms to ensure customizations access only their data, safeguarding privacy and integrity.

### 4.5 Security and Compliance

- **Data Encryption**: Tools should be recommended for encrypting sensitive data, ensuring security in transit and at rest.
- **Compliance Adherence**: Management practices must adhere to data protection laws and privacy standards.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

- Provide documentation and examples for implementing data persistence and state management within customizations.
- Recommend tools and libraries that facilitate easy integration and development of robust data and state management solutions.

## 6. Use Cases

- **Persistent User Customizations**: Enable users to maintain custom dashboard layouts or theme settings across uses and devices.
- **Customization Data Sharing**: Facilitate the sharing of customization data among users or devices for consistent experiences.

## 7. Conclusion

DPSM-RNRA provides a comprehensive framework for effective and secure management of state and data within user customizations, enhancing the overall ecosystem of React and React-Native applications. By adopting these guidelines, base application developers can support customization developers in creating more engaging and persistent user experiences.
