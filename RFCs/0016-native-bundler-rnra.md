# Native Bundler for React Native Applications (Native-Bundler-RNRA)

## 1. Introduction

This RFC introduces the Native Bundler for React Native Applications (Native-Bundler-RNRA), a component designed to facilitate the bundling of user customizations and application code directly within React Native applications. The Native-Bundler-RNRA aims to provide a robust solution for in-app code editing, configuration, and bundling, supporting a range of customization options from simple configuration files to restricted JSX components and full-blown in-app bundling capabilities.

## 2. Background

As React Native applications grow in complexity and user customization becomes more prevalent, there is a need for a native bundling solution that allows users to customize and extend their applications from within the app itself. This includes the ability to modify configuration files, create custom JSX components with restricted syntax, and bundle application code in real-time.

## 3. Objectives

- To create a native bundling tool within React Native applications that supports user customizations and code bundling.
- To enable users to customize their application experience through configuration files and restricted JSX components.
- To provide developers with the ability to bundle application code directly within the app, streamlining the development and customization process.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 User Customizations via Config Files

- **Config File Editing**: Allow users to modify application behavior by editing configuration files within a secure and intuitive interface.

### 4.2 User Customizations via Restricted JSX

- **JSX Parsing and Validation**: Implement a JSX parser that enables users to create custom JSX components with restricted syntax, ensuring safe and controlled execution of custom code.

### 4.3 In-App Bundling Solution

- **Real-Time Code Bundling**: Develop an in-app bundling solution that compiles and bundles code changes on-the-fly, allowing for immediate updates and previews of customizations.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

- **Modular Design**: Ensure the Native-Bundler-RNRA is modular and extensible, allowing for future enhancements and integration with other React Native tooling and libraries.
- **Security Measures**: Incorporate security measures to protect the application and user data from malicious code during the customization process.

## 6. Use Cases

- **Dynamic Application Customization**: Users can tailor the application to their preferences by modifying config files or creating custom JSX components.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Developers can quickly prototype and test new features within the application environment, reducing development cycles.

## 7. Conclusion

The Native-Bundler-RNRA represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of React Native applications, providing a powerful tool for both users and developers to customize and extend their applications from within the app itself. This in-app bundling solution promises to enhance the development workflow, increase user engagement, and open up new possibilities for application customization and personalization.
